# Multithreading-in-PHP-with-POSIX-Threads

## POSIX Threads or pthreads 
____
pthreads is an object oriented API that provides all of the tools needed for multi-threading in PHP (on other platforms also but we are dealing with PHP). 

pthreads API makes it easier for developers to implement threading in PHP by abstracting the underlying implementation details and only exposing the objects or actions that the developer needs. (No shit son, that's what an Application Programming Interface does.)
